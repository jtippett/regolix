## Project Notes

Rustler NIF scaffold for Regolix:
- `mix rustler.new` requires interactive input for module name and library name
- The generator creates: native/regolix/Cargo.toml, native/regolix/src/lib.rs, native/regolix/README.md, and root Cargo.toml
- It does NOT create the Elixir module file (lib/regolix/native.ex) - you must create that manually following the README instructions
- The Elixir module uses `use Rustler, otp_app: :regolix, crate: "regolix"` and needs stub functions that return `:erlang.nif_error(:nif_not_loaded)`
- regorus 0.5 dependency added successfully and compiles
- priv/native/ contains compiled .so files - should be gitignored
- Cargo.lock should be committed (standard practice for applications/NIFs)
